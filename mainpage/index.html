  <h2> Intro </h2>

     <p> This page is to firstly tell you a little bit  about myself, my interests, hobbies and to show off my web development skills I possess to build my own website. Everything you see has been written by code, I gained the knowledge to do this mostly been self-taught, I hope every time you see this, there will be new content which I have learnt and wanting to share with you.  </p>

  <h2> About myself </h2>
      
    <p>I'd like to think of myself as open minded, considerate, self-driven and focused on what I want to achieve. The past few months I have come to realise that the career I have been doing for most my life hasn't been my true passion, I have been able to spend time to myself, being able to reflect on what will truly make me happy and the decision I made was to get involved in the web development sector. </p>

    <p> Take a look at the pages below to get more of an insight into who i am and what i enjoy. </p>
