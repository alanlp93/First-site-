    <h2> Past work </h2>

    <p>   My past has been involved in the building trade, I have been a labour for builders which included helping plasterers, painters, landscapers and various others. A yard supervisor for 2 separate building merchant, sales assistant for a tool hire company and able to drive forklifts, boom lifts and scissor lifts. Even though I have decided to change my career I have never thought of my past work experiences as a waste. I believe some, if not most skills and knowledge I have learnt in the past 12 years I can bring to my new career which include having a great eye for detail, being dedicated to my work and wanting to keep up to date with changes in the role I do. </p>
